# TBA

I won’t say this dot files best. I wouldn’t argue about simplicity and systematic of components. It’s just work. You don’t need to adjust it. It’s already self fulfilled. 

Right now I will explain what it consists. (Describe components)

Last peace of gear is a release control, update to keep it fresh (or setup a cron)

You can be confident with this setup. It will evolve with us! 

End of dotfiles project article 


I will add mode about explaining the shell features, whole new concepts of scripts, hacks to your efficient!
